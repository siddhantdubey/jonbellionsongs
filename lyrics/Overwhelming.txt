[Intro]
I'm working on dying

[Chorus]
Posted in the trenches, yeah, that's where I'm flexing
Philly what I'm repping, Oogie Mane, he killed it
Matt OX in the building, 'bout to break the ceiling
I don't think you feel me, am I too overwhelming?
Posted in the trenches, yeah, that's where I'm flexing
Philly what I'm repping, Oogie Mane, he killed it
Matt OX in the building, 'bout to break the ceiling
I don't think you feel me, am I too overwhelming?

[Verse]
I-I-I don't think they know where I be at (Be at)
I don't think they know who I be with (Be with)
Yeah, I'm headed to the top for the millions (The millions)
And I'm staying with my gang, I ain't scheming (Never)
Used to hate on me, used to sleep on me
Now I'm almost at the top where I was dreaming to be
Now they waiting for a song, they be fiending on me
Know lots of my homies still hustle on the streets
Yeah, I'm in the kitchen and you know I'm whipping
All my sauce is dripping, dip my chicken in it
Boy, you know I'm flexing, yeah, I'm up next, man
Riding in the Lexus, my homies get big checks
When I'm in the hood I'm the Big Bad Wolf
I be getting to this guap and it never is enough
I'ma get all this money 'til my bank is filled too much
I don't know why they fuss, they ain't ready for us

[Chorus]
P-P-Posted in the trenches, yeah, that's where I'm flexing
Philly what I'm repping, Oogie Mane, he killed it
Matt OX in the building, 'bout to break the ceiling
I don't think you feel me, am I too overwhelming?
P-P-Posted in the trenches, yeah, that's where I'm flexing
Philly what I'm repping, Oogie Mane, he killed it
Matt OX in the building, 'bout to break the ceiling
I don't think you feel me, am I too overwhelming?
