Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone

Still living in his dad’s house, twenty four years old
He could buy a few pads, but he just like to stay home
No, he never took the fast route, now the plaque's on deck
But they still make him take the trash out, keep his ass in check
Same kids from the high school, jump shot still flame
Couple million in the bank, but
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same

Yeah yeah yeah

His assistant is his best friend
Lost his dad that day
Really puts it in perspective
What the fuck's a bad day?
Sister told him "Keep your head right, " twenty four years old
Real women need love, fake bitches want gold

Same kids from the high school, jump shot still flame
Couple million in the bank, but
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same

All he needed was a platform, built a real fanbase
Took ’em with him when the deal came
Selling out in every state
Signed a deal after his first tape
But he kept it on the low
They could never say he sold out
That's why they come to every show

Same kids from the high school, jump shot still flame
Couple million in the bank, but
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same

Kiss
Made it this far
Made it this
