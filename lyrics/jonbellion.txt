[Hook]
Yeah, I built them with my own 2 hands
I carved your name in one
And my name in the other
I built them with my own 2 hands
They're over there, two rocking chairs

[Verse 1]
Leaves fall, rain dries
Snow melts, fame dies
Four words, simply
Grow old, with me

[Pre-Hook]
And when the day comes
When we can't walk no more
We'll have 2 seats, on my front porch
I'll still call you young girl
So young girl, rock with me

[Hook]
Yeah, I built them with my own 2 hands
I carved your name in one
And my name in the other
I built them with my own 2 hands
They're over there, two rocking chairs

[Verse 2]
No watch, no time
Just life and your eyes
Four words, simply
Grow old with me

[Pre-Hook]
And when the day comes
When we can't walk no more
We'll have 2 seats, on my front porch
I'll still call you young girl
So young girl, rock with me

[Hook]
Yeah, I built them with my own 2 hands
I carved your name in one
And my name in the other
I built them with my own 2 hands
They're over there, two rocking chairs

[Outro]
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Just rock with me
Just rock with me
[Chorus]
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive

[Verse 1]
She said, "How does it feel to be you?"
I said, "It's alright, I really think I peaked in high school"
She said, "That isn't possible, you are out of your mind
'Cause we never hooked up in high school"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We just need a night like
We just need a night like this, yeah
Take me back to ninth grade
Take me back to ninth grade shit, yeah

[Chorus]
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive

[Verse 2]
She said, "How'd we end up in the parking lot in Smithtown?"
The morning's on its way to sunrise
She said, "The island is long, but life is short in this town
I'm glad we got to redo the time"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We just need a night like
We just need a night like this, yeah
Take me back to ninth grade
Take me back to ninth grade shit, yeah
And just like the 80's films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive

[Chorus]
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive

[Bridge]
I can't let go and your lips feel retro
You're my Breakfast Club
You're my song from Cyndi Lauper
No more missed times, we fly by street signs
Let your hips rewind
Take me back into the future, yeah

[Chorus]
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive

[Verse 1]
Such haunting nightmares
From past loves that tried to screw me
But you were the preacher in an exorcism movie, my love
And that corny theme song
Always plays when you're next to me
Like, "Who you gonna call?"

[Chorus]
The ghosts of my exes they cry, "Oh, oh"
Cause they know that's it's their time to go, oh oh oh
The ghosts of my exes they cry, "Oh, oh"
They know that it's their time to go, oh oh oh
Cause since you walked on through my door
This ain't no haunted house no more

[Verse 2]
You took my hand and walked me into my dark attic
That's where my heart was lost and frozen in a casket, my love
My soul was mummified, you helped me to unwrap it
It's you I'm gonna call

[Chorus]
The ghosts of my exes they cry, "Oh, oh"
Cause they know that's it's their time to go, oh oh oh
The ghosts of my exes they cry, "Oh, oh"
They know that it's their time to go, oh oh oh
Cause since you walked on through my door
This ain't no haunted house no more

[Bridge]
I've been saved
Watch them all fall back into the grave
I've been saved
Watch them all fall back into the grave

[Chorus]
The ghosts of my exes they cry, "Oh, oh"
Cause they know that's it's their time to go, oh oh oh
The ghosts of my exes they cry, "Oh, oh"
They know that it's their time to go, oh oh oh
Cause since you walked on through my door
This ain't no haunted house no more
[Intro: Christopher Sabat]
TUAMIE has developed a new hyperbolic time chamber
Here on Namek, we'll be focusing on the mental
Training starts now, begin

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
Ooh, I've just been fanning myself, I'm a such a fan of myself
There's levels to the cool like a fan on a shelf
When you blow, they try to gas you like fans at the Shell station
God hands me a full plate, but I handle it well
If they don't feel your thoughts, start dreaming in braille
They'll try to sell you short 'cause their dreams are for sale
They'll say "Get off your podium, life isn't Nickelodeon"
Orange you so dumb?" Kenan and Kel, wow
The government leaves an animal trail
So I switch to swiss chard, carrots, and kale
So I'll remember my kid's name, dementia is a sick game
I'm silence in the lamb, call me Hannibal Failed, yeah
Financial plans should be handled in stealth
I fight to lead a private life for my family's health
Got some dinner with art collectors, they started drinkin' Prosecco
When they slipped about their level of family wealth
Bunch of actresses downplay how my records have felt
It's not a mystery to decode a fan in yourself
"This man's on fire," I can't pretend I'm not talented
For me to fake humble's a corny way to be arrogant
Drug dealers still on the corner of Madison
Except they push Pradas and Red Bottoms to Madisons
Red bottoms for baboons and radishes
I went to Mozambique and saw a real kind of happiness
So I don't feel guilty when Nike sends me some packages
We still end up in boxes even though we chase packagin', mm

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion & Christopher Sabat]
Take this, take this, TUAMIE supply the face lift, uh
Take this, take this, TUAMIE supply the face lift
I can't fall off, I got a great grip
Go and find some talent, have a great trip, uh
This Bellion guy's power level is amazing
Uh, take this, take this, TUAMIE supply the face lift, mm
Prepare to fight
My stance here as a band leader is Pangaea
My heart frío, I'm cold, heater than Cambria
I rock steady, my Johnson's Dwayne-heavy
We just erase heroes, I'll Stan Lee ya, Remini, he the king of Queens
My bars breathe Lebron's Kia, I carry greatness
Statements on spaceship, Haitians get LASIK
Meaning you dread what comes from my third eye
Blind to the fake shit (Wow)
My tone is gettin' aggressive
I just create for the truly gifted of adolescence
My essence becomes the mystery
I instantly become a Pistol Pete in a sport full of Walt Fraziers
My Kelsey Grammer is something like Thor with a hammer
Special-
Like Alfred Hitchcock with a camera
Beam-
Just blazin', Killer Cam with a sample
Both hands on the candle can't handle it
Cannon!
My channel too hot to cancel, my baby's drivin'
I'm Ansel
I'm passenger writin' stanzas, I'm holdin' these verses ransom
I'm Hansel Zoolander handsome
TUAMIE supply the face lift

[Verse 3: Jon Bellion & Christopher Sabat]
It's all because of (Jesus)
Well done, welcome to Glory Sound Prep
I'm lovin' it all, here with my brother-in-law
Greece is a beautiful place, food is incredible, awe
We just been playin' some games, everyone's pickin' a straw
Who gets the longest has gotta go tell the butler to call
For more alcohol
Wait, we'd told the locals that we'd go and play basketball
But they don't want the business
Plus, I drank from the flask we bought, now everything is spinnin'
Then we laugh it off
Ooh, it's Whoopi Goldberg the way that my sisters act up, uh
They had some champagne, now everybody's laughing
Movies 'bout paradise, and my family got the casting
If you dove into the tears of my eyes, you'd hear this instrumental
Jesus was instrumental in blessing my mental
Every time I drove a car, could've twisted the metal
Yeah, all the things on my wish list, God has given in triplets
I'm on an island where opiates go to rich kids
And then they pass away, that's called death over the privileged
Yeah, I never wanna be famous, stop calling me underrated
I'm still pushin' the same whip I was drivin' in Sachem, uh
Peace in my life, it's awesome, As-salamu alaykum
I'm makin' certain decisions, I'm flyin' under the radar
I really love my life and this music thing is a great job
Yeah, pick up the phone and someone tells me, "Mr. Bellion, sir
Beyoncé on the line, she tryna reach you on your cellular"
She wanted "Fall In Line," but we gave it to Aguilera, uhh
I hope it's the right decision, Bey wanted it for the twins she signed
I hope I didn't burn that bridge, I worry all the time
I'm just tryna show these kids about this slight of mine
I always flex, but I realize that it's divine appointment
I'm a cross between hard work and Jesus-anointed
I hope the sinner that needed grace is the final notion
For the rest of my life, you'll see me on the L-I-double R
With a Heineken in my bag, on my way to the Garden
Tryin' to kill your nephews like I been fuckin' with Scar
Me lyin' down on the job is Nala option at all, uh
On my way to the Garden, uh, uh
On my way to the, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
On my way to the Gar-
[Verse 1]
I was the knight in shining armor in your movie
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie, lie, l-lie I tried to hide
But now you know it

[Chorus]
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

[Verse 2]
I was the prototype like 3 Stacks on that CD
An example of the perfect candidate
Now, all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate

[Pre-Chorus]
I, (I, I) I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie I tried to hide
But now you know it

[Chorus]
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

[Bridge]
I, I, I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie and try to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Lie, l-lie, I try to hide, but now you know it
That I'm at an all time...
Hey!

Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Is this the American?
Is this the American?
Is this the American?
Is this the Ame–

[Chorus]
Woke up in London with you next to me
Made love in Brixton with both hands around your neck
I'm back in New York on British ecstasy
So I feel like an immigrant in America
Yes, I am just an immigrant in America

[Verse 1]
Cigar and cigarette ashes
As I open all my luggage up
I still speak my native language
But I only want your foreign tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember? Remember?
When you spilled coffee on my J
Coffee on my J Dilla vinyl
I didn't even mind, didn't even mind (crazy)
When you spilled coffee on my J
Coffee on my J Dilla vinyl
I didn't even mind, didn't even mind (baby)

[Chorus]
Woke up in London with you next to me
Made love in Brixton with both hands around your neck
I'm back in New York on British ecstasy
So, I feel like an immigrant in America
Yes, I am just an immigrant in America

[Verse 2]
South London, born in Colombia
Texts in Spanish that she's all alone
She said she's found an apartment
I'm in Harlem, screaming, "take me home"

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember? Remember?
When you spilled coffee on my J
Coffee on my J Dilla vinyl
I didn't even mind, didn't even mind (crazy)
When you spilled coffee on my J
Coffee on my J Dilla vinyl
I didn't even mind, didn't even mind (baby)

[Outro]
Woke up in London with you next to me
Made love in Brixton with both hands around your neck
I'm back in New York on British ecstasy
So, I feel like an immigrant in America, I miss you
Yes, I feel like an immigrant in America, that's how I feel...
[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 1]
Two crowns and a gold cup
And they're coming for the throne, love
But if your heart is a dog fight
Then I'm ready to go to war like
Rough sex in the courtyard
And your legs are the North Star
Church bells let me ring them
She looked back, said, "Baby, this your kingdom"

[Chorus]
If you're lost in this darkness
I'll carry your throne
No, I won't let it swallow you whole

[Verse 2]
They try to break inside the walls with
These lies but I'm pulling up the draw bridge
We rose this love from the dirt now
Set fire to the sky watch it burn down
It's a ceremony but the crowd's gone
And you got nothing but my crown on
Round 2, round 3, give me sequels
Every time you open the cathedral

[Chorus]
If you're lost in this darkness
I'll carry your throne
No, I won't let it swallow you whole
If you're lost in this darkness
I'll carry your throne
No, I won't let it swallow you whole
[Verse 1]
Heard he was born as a beast and a ghost
On the East of a coast where they eat you for jokes, uh
I know a guy who said his mom knew a man
Whose mother's sister saw him in the mall one time
Heard he was high and he rode to the sky
And it opened and God played a song he recorded
He wrote it down
But he only play the record for his wife sometimes
Heard he survived, on an island with Vikes
That provided the Valkyries, sirens, and pirates
Don’t know the guy, yeah, uh
But they talk about his verses in the night sometimes

[Chorus]
Big bang, the six, the seven
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the six, the seven
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the king, the legend

[Verse 2]
Heard he was formed from the lights that are Northern
The Rock of Gibraltar, he once got an offer
From Lucifer's daughter to bow to the gods
So he'd keep his verses sharper than a knife sometimes
Heard he was warned that a hero gets torn
Between fame and adornment and loses his sword
So he shot the fame down, uh
But he keep a mask on him if the sign’s in the sky
Heard he was happy so no one could gas him
Or force him to dance like a monkey for assets
He loves his life
But he keep a pen sharp enough to write one time

[Chorus]
Big bang, the six, the seven
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the six, the seven
Hey hey, the king, the legend
Big bang, the truth, the weapon
Hey hey, the king, the legend

[Bridge]
He struck down gods and he killed an army
Stood up on top of a hill of bodies
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
Put up both hands, made the lightning come down
Rep got so big that it blocked the sun out
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself

[Outro]
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
He just needed saving from himself
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
He just needed (The king, the legend)
It was never enough, he just needed saving from himself
The king, the legend
Himself
The king, the legend
The king, the legend
[Pre-Chorus]
I dreamt I slept on a sidewalk, but you still laid with me
I dreamt I fell in a lion's den, and you still came for me
I dreamt I lost all of my faith, and you still prayed for me
Who the fuck cares about these plaques on my wall?
You're still the only thing I've done right

[Chorus]
Will you love me when my phone turns off?
I don't want to be some digital Jesus
No more followers, we'll both get lost
When it's me and you inside real life
Will you love me when my phone turns off?
I don't want to be some digital Jesus
No more followers, we'll both get lost
When it's me and you inside real life
I just want me and you inside real life
(I just want me and you inside real life)

[Bridge]
They'll say that I fell off, and it's alright
(They'll say that I fell off, and it's alright)
I'm so ready to run from the spotlight
(So ready to run from the spotlight)
They'll say that I fell off, and it's alright
(They'll say that I fell off, and it's alright)
I'm so ready to run from the spotlight

[Pre-Chorus]
I dreamt I slept on a sidewalk, but you still laid with me
Who the fuck cares about these...
I dreamt I fell in a lion's den, and you still came for me
Who the fuck cares about these...
I dreamt I lost all of my faith, and you still prayed for me
Who the fuck cares about these plaques on my wall?
You're still the only thing I've done right

[Chorus]
Will you love me when my phone turns off?
I don't want to be some digital Jesus
No more followers, we'll both get lost
When it's me and you inside real life
Will you love me when my phone turns off?
I don't want to be some digital Jesus
No more followers, we'll both get lost
When it's me and you inside real life
I just want me and you inside real life
(I just want me and you inside real life)
(Ahhh)

[Outro]
(Ahhh)
They'll say that I fell off, and it's alright
I'm so ready to run from the spotlight
[Verse 1]
I might have been tired, you might have been hungry
I might have said something, you might have done nothing
You know you still love me
I might have been wired, you probably need coffee
I know I keep chips on my shoulder like dip
So come get it off me

[Chorus]
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come and dance with me
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
Come and dance with me
Come and dance for me (Dance for me, dance for me)

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna get
I wanna get

[Verse 2]
You crashed in my car, I fucked up vacation
I tried to change this and you tried to change that
But it's just in our nature
I desperately care, you're hopelessly on me
I try to stay pissed, and you try to stay mad
'Til I grab your hips softly

[Chorus]
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come and dance with me
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
Come and dance with me
Come and dance for me (Dance for me, dance for me)

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna get
I wanna get

[Bridge]
I wanna get close
Let me get close, let me get close (Close, close, close)
I wanna get close
Let me get close, let me get close (Close, close, close)

[Chorus]
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come say sorry with your body
Come and dance with me
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
I'll say sorry with my body
Come and dance with me
Toda las jevas con cadera, que esto va pa' bajo

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna get
I wanna get (Close)
I wanna get (Close)
[Intro]
You know, maybe I'm drunk, maybe I'm not
Maybe this happened, maybe it didn't

[Chorus]
Call my doctor, call my lawyer
Call my brother, call my priest
There's paperwork to fill out
'Cause a dead man walks the streets
'Cause my sister has a best friend
That I've known since I was three
And now I'm gon' get strangled
'Cause we tangled in the sheets
My homies like, "Dead man, dead man walking"
My homies like, "You a dead man, dead man walking"

[Verse 1]
Yeah, uh, come on
Beautiful family friend is she
Almost a decade older than me
And I've been gone for quite a while overseas, yeah
And she's been living up in Albany, yeah yeah
Then I had two shows I played upstate
She came to show love and see my face
Then we got drinks and we chilled like, "Hey"
And then from there it was, you know, what I'm saying

[Chorus]
Call my doctor, call my lawyer
Call my brother, call my priest

My homies like, "You a dead man, dead man walking"
My homies like, "Dead man, dead man walking"
My homies like, "You a dead man, dead man walking"

[Verse 2]
Now she's like, "Damn, how did we let this happen?
Damn, how did we end up in this bed?"
Then I said, "Relax" and laughed like
"This would be a pretty dope song."
She's like, "No, I swear to God I'll kill you
No, I really will just take your life
No, don't even think about it
But that would be a pretty dope song"
So I came home and I called my friends
Then we got smacked and I wrote this jam
I know for a fact that we going...
It's over, my life is deadass over

[Chorus]
Call my doctor, call my lawyer
Call my brother, call my priest
There's paperwork to fill out

My homies like, "You a dead man, dead man walking"
Yeah yeah, my homies like, "Dead man, dead man walking"
My homies like, "You a dead man, dead man walking"

[Outro]
The funny part about this entire thing
You know, like doing the one-take, write it quick, fun jokes?
But my sister won't hear this until I release the album
She'll hear every other song except this one
So, surprise
[Verse 1]
Yeah, see, check the bounce out
Welcome to the dope flow, welcome to the bounce, mane
Live inside my music, so welcome to my house, mane
Welcome, I'm a beat carpenter, and I'm a wordsmith
Welcome to that brand-spanking-new-you-never-heard shit
Welcome to the kid that bring a industry a new day
But some hater chefs cooking bullshit souffle
Welcome to the grindstone, welcome to the pipe dream
Bounced up out of college 'cause I'm taking care of my dream
Welcome to the definition of a frickin; lab rat
With just a dream, and a dollar, and a backpack
But all he cares about is family and good tunes
So don't ask him 'bout his next move

[Chorus]
I haven't even picked out my socks
How could I tell you about my future
Tell you 'bout my future
How could I tell you, t-t-tell you bout
Please don't ask me what my next move is
'Cause I just don't know
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know, yeah
Middle finger to the sky like this
'Cause I just don't know
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
We just don't know, we just don't know, yeah
We just don't know, we just don't know

[Verse 2]
Beautiful Mind
Welcome to the positive, negatives a no-go
Young Sensei building up his dojo
Young Boston, got the smile and the mojo
He dreams yachts while he's sleeping in a rowboat
Almost there, almost there, so we go-go
Go, go, stop, stop. Stop, stop? No, no
I'm a Wizard of the odd, Toto
Dancing with a Dorothy, telling her to go slow
Dancing with a Dorothy, telling her to go slow
Dancing with a Dorothy, telling her to, telling her to

[Chorus]
I haven't even picked out my socks
How could I tell you about my future
Tell you 'bout my future

'Cause I just don't know
'Cause I just don't know
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know, yeah
We just don't know, we just don't know, yeah
We just don't know, we just don't know
[Verse 1]
(Oh yeah)
Anxiety dance across my pillow case
My god it dances—it’s like, 1, 2 step
It’s asking stupid questions
Like, "Are you living right?"
Such stupid questions
Because I'm just trying to—

[Pre-Hook]
I'm trying live, I'm trying rise
Above the shit, the devil tries
Which is why I keep my eyes to the sky

[Hook]
Insert something really dope right here
I’m supposed to write a hook but all I wanna say is
I just want to be happy (I just want to be happy)
Want to be happy (Yeah)
I’m supposed to write a f’ing hook right here
Money and riches blah blah yeah yeah
I just want to be happy (I just want to be happy)
Want to be happy (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I've been working my ass off
That’s why Christina left me
Been working my ass off
On this project, but I guess that it’s okay
My family never liked you, I guess that it’s okay
Now I’m just, I’m just—

[Pre-Hook]
I’m trying live I'm trying rise
Above the shit the devil tries
Which is why I keep my eyes to the sky

[Hook]
Insert something really dope right here
I’m supposed to write a hook but all I wanna say is
I just want to be happy
(I just want to be happy)
Want to be happy (Yeah)
I’m supposed to write a f’ing hook right here
Money and riches blah blah yeah yeah
I just want to be happy
(I just want to be happy)
Want to be happy (Yeah)

[Verse 3:]
Listen boo boo, bear with me (yeah)
Smarter than your average
Raised around Brooklyn based Italian
There’s so much soul up in my Johnson
I don’t need a rapper on it
Because the urbans in my testes
But I come in pop packaging (Yikes)
Bunch of pricks talk shit, we call that cactusing
We don’t want no fight club don’t want no Brad Pitt’in
Braymance like this shit just when I'm ad-libbin'
Fronting on my Sean Penn what movie are you actin in?
Seventh grade I said "I’m bout to leave the masses then"
My ex-girlfriend's sister said “you babbling”
Even back then cook crack, drug trafficking

[Outro]
I'm trying live, I'm trying rise
Above the shit, the devil tries
Which is why I keep my eyes to the sky
You’re gonna be okay kid, you’re gonna be, okay

[Verse 1: TiRon]
When you're young they tell you to get yours
But when you get old they tell you to get back
They start to close doors right up in your face
Like it ain't no thang, you caught in they trap
And now you're feeling lost, ain't got no map
Try to double back b-back, but can't do it
Cool outside, but inside you're losing your faith
And you hate the fact you ain't moving, yup
And you hate the fact you feel stuck (ugh)
Yup, you feel stuck
B-B-But, if i know one thing you should trust that thing inside of your gut
When you know that its just right
Know that it's just right
Know that it's just right

[Verse 2: Ayomari]
When you're grown they tell you get up
Get out and d-duh-d-do it
Shake the dust off, brush your shirt off
Work all day and night
Get up off your booty
B-B-But, if I must say I'm trying to get paid to play
Trying to get paid to play
Cash in, hit the jackpot
Jackpot, jackpot
'Til I'm winning in a major way
Major, m-m-made you look
Hungry in my stomach so I came to cook
Crooked letter, T-I-R
Stir it up, stir it up
Until I know that it's just right

[Bridge]
Know when it's just right
Know when it's just right
Right
Right
Know when it's just right
Right
Right
Know when it's just right
Know when it's just right
Know when it's just right
Right, right

Everybody say yeah
This ones for the dreamers up in here
Say yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 3: TiRon]
I know what it feel like, what it feel like
If I never made it big would I still write?
Never had a number one, never won nothing
Would I keep keep going on and on? (On and on)
Or get a J-O-B that I hate till it aches
Throw the towel in, see y'all on break
Trying to move but standing in one place

[Verse 4: Ayomari]
Gotta move 'cause moving is what it takes
If you feelin boo boo sitting on your doo doo maker
Can't take you where you wanna
Wanna do it, do it? Gotta own up, yup
Ain't nothin but a thang cause you know when it's just right

[Bridge]
Know when it's just right

[Hook]
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!

[Verse 1]
Sit in the dark and ponder how
I'm fit to make the bottom fall through the floor
And they all fall down - yuh!
(It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes - yuh!)
Out of the shadows barrage of witch tongue
Cobra spit over apocalyptic cult killer cauldron smoke
Stomp music seriously - yuh!
(It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes)
Can't stop the groove licks jaws clear off them locks relentless raw movement
Fit to knock you from here to that g-spot body rock connected
To everything you want, ever did want, we got it why not come get it
Stick your head in that hole and watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence - yuh! yuh!

[Hook]
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!

[Verse 2]
Hidden art, between and beneath, every fragmented, figure of speech
Tongue in reverse, whenever the beat
Causes my jaws to call out, out, out, out - yuh!
The screens flashing red, can't see shit but heads
Spinning exorcist like planets out of orbit off the edge
Off mine axis whipping through doors to far more than all that’s ever been said - yuh!
Tie the chord, kick the chair and you're dead - yuh! Yuh!

[Hook]
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!
Guillotine - yuh!

[Verse 3]
Head of a trick in a bucket, body of a trick in a bag
And thrown in the fire like fuck it, gotta burn it before it goes bad
One too many times been disgusted by the stench of rot is such a drag - yuh!
Get broke by the street like blood stained glass - yuh!
Choke on these nuts till the very last - yuh!
(It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes)
Serial number, killing machine, the illest of means
To an end built on the filthy sound you're experiencing - yuh! yuh!

[Hook]
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine - yuh!
Guillotine - yuh!

[Verse 4]
Tinted windows, bulletproof
The slip knot fixing rope to noose
To the grave stone grinder of cold steel
The passion that blinds me so I feel - yuh!
Can't let go, no it flows through our veins
Blows through our tunnels and rattles our chains
And they all fall down - yuh! Yuh! Yuh! Yuh!
[Intro]
I'm livin' like "catch me if you can," you know?
This the amazin' true story of the youngest and most darin' conman
Tricky, swiftly, but yet viciously
It's always a mystery
Every day a new identity
I ain't talking cereal, but
I got all the tricks
Silly bitch, and I'ma finesse kid
Yeah, we ain't got nothin' for you tricks but some rabbit food
I could be ya professor 'cause I'll school ya
I shoulda been born in April 'cause I fool ya

[Chorus]
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets
Like really I shoulda been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like a sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

[Verse 1]
Popping monkeys, popping bottles, make me swing
Who the fuck you walking in and out my dreams?
I know I'm smart, you make me do some crazy things
Monkey on my back, let a nigga be
Please, niggas free out here but they ain't free
You out here physically, locked up mentally
'Bout everywhere I go, I gotta bring the ski
No face, no case, live everyday like Halloween

[Chorus]
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets
Like really I shoulda been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen, but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like the sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

[Verse 2]
I'd trick so much individuals for a treat
K Boogie with a Hoodie, best believe
It's hot he got the hoodie on to hide the heat
And he got so much tricks up his sleeve
All the nights I had to mask up on the scheme
My subconscious got me fighting in my sleep
I can't forget about it I see it in my dreams
I'm kicking in your door, but I don't want no sweets
I'm giving you what I came for so I can leave
You know I'm serious don't you feel my energy
No this not a joke, everybody on they knees
Don't try to buck jack, you get buckeyed back

[Chorus]
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets
Like really I shoulda been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen, but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like the sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

[Verse 3]
You ain't gotta be scared just respect a nigga please
I'm starting to think my cranium got a disease
They be like yo Kodak I just seen you on the scene
They be like I ain't approach you though, cuz you was looking mean
Don't need no friends I gotta big family
I'm a G, it's in my genes
Glock 23, it's in my jeans
You playing freeze tag but I got that beam
Sorry baby I lied, you was just a fling
I don't love ya, I just wanna get in yo jeans
Tricked her for her treat, tricked her out her panties
I can't get romantic
No I'm not satanic

[Outro]
I'm not satanic
Who said that?
Why you said that?
Who said that?
[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
My head spins, I've been sipping
I've been sipping, I've been sipping lately
All my sins, I've been tripping, I've been tripping, my God
Brand new life, I've been looking
I've been looking, I've been looking lately
All these nights, they've been cooking
They've been cooking me raw

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
I am just a man, I am just a man who lusts, gives, tries
Sometimes, I lose my way

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Tears at a funeral, tears at a funeral, I might break
Angry at all the things, angry at all the things I can't change
When you're lost in the universe, lost in the universe, don't lose faith
My mother says, "Your whole life's in the hand of God"

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Break it down
Your whole life's in the hand of...
Your whole life's in the hand of God

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
My ex girl, I've been seeing
I've been seeing, I've been seeing lately
She's got hopes that we're getting back together, my God
I just know that I'm horny and I'm lonely, just admit it's crazy
She just holds on to something that she knows is long gone
Damn

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
I am just a man, I am just a man who lusts, gives, tries
Sometimes, I lose my way

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Tears at a funeral, tears at a funeral, I might break
Angry at all the things, angry at all the things I can't change
When you're lost in the universe, lost in the universe, don't lose faith
My mother says, "Your whole life's in the hand of God"

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Break it down
Your whole life's in the hand of...
Your whole life's in the hand of God

[Chorus: Sheldon Ray & The Andre Crouch Choir]
Tears at a funeral, tears at a funeral, I might break
Angry at all the things, angry at all the things I can't change
When you're lost in the universe, lost in the universe, don't lose faith
My mother said, "Your, your whole life is in the hand of God"

[Outro: Sheldon Ray & The Andre Crouch Choir]
Nothing has changed, he is the same
"Your whole life's in the hand of God"
Nothing has changed, he is the same
"Your whole life's in the hand of God"
"Your whole life's in the hand of God"
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Bum ba-dem, bum bum, buh-da
Bum ba-dem, bum bum, buh-da
Nothing has changed
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Bum ba-dem, bum bum, buh-da
Bum ba-dem, bum bum, buh-da
"Your whole life's in the hand of God"
Tears at a funeral, tears at a funeral, I might break
I might break
Angry at all the things, angry at all the things I can't change
Angry at all the things I could not change
When you're lost in the universe, lost in the universe, don't lose faith
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
My mother says, "Your whole life's in the hand of God"
Tears at a funeral, tears at a funeral, I might break
Just like the 80s films
We'll hook up in my back seat and let my best friend drive
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Overwhelming
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Overwhelming
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
"Your whole life's in the hand of God"
Lay me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Long Island’s only smiling cause my soul is fine
Bum ba-dem, bum bum, buh-da
Bum ba-dem, bum bum, buh-da
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Bum ba-dem, bum bum, buh-da
I did everything for New York
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone

Still living in his dad’s house, twenty four years old
He could buy a few pads, but he just like to stay home
No, he never took the fast route, now the plaque's on deck
But they still make him take the trash out, keep his ass in check
Same kids from the high school, jump shot still flame
Couple million in the bank, but
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same

Yeah yeah yeah

His assistant is his best friend
Lost his dad that day
Really puts it in perspective
What the fuck's a bad day?
Sister told him "Keep your head right, " twenty four years old
Real women need love, fake bitches want gold

Same kids from the high school, jump shot still flame
Couple million in the bank, but
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same

All he needed was a platform, built a real fanbase
Took ’em with him when the deal came
Selling out in every state
Signed a deal after his first tape
But he kept it on the low
They could never say he sold out
That's why they come to every show

Same kids from the high school, jump shot still flame
Couple million in the bank, but
Nothing has changed, he is the same
Nothing has changed, he is the same

Kiss
Made it this far
Made it this
[Intro]
I'm only human
I'm only, I'm only
I'm only human, human

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind
Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind
Got no way to prove it, so maybe I'm lying

[Refrain]
But I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

[Verse 2]
Take a look in the mirror and what do you see?
Do you see it clearer, or are you deceived
In what you believe?

[Refrain]
'Cause I'm only human after all
You're only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

[Chorus]
Some people got the real problems
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

[Verse 3]
Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie
Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry
Making you cry

[Refrain]
'Cause I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

[Chorus]
Some people got the real problems
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me
I'm only human, I make mistakes
I'm only human, that's all it takes
To put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm no prophet or Messiah
You should go looking somewhere higher

[Outro]
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me
I'm only human, I do what I can
I'm just a man, I do what I can
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me
[Verse 1]
I was a human, breathing and thinking
Eating and drinking, philosophizing
I was a human, before you killed me
And ripped my heart out, I knew what love was

[Pre-Chorus]
Now when they ask me, I just reply slow
And sound like an iPhone
I do not know love, I am a robot
Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba
I do not know love, I am a robot
Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba
I used to know love

[Chorus]
Cause I had a fire, passion and desire
Now all I require are circuits and wires
Inside was an ocean of soul and emotion
Then you cut me open, now all that I know is—

[Verse 2]
I am a robot, thoughtless and empty
Don't know who sent me, don't know who made me
Electric robot, everything's gray now
Numb to the pain now, I knew what love was

[Pre-Chorus]
Now when they ask me, I just reply slow
And sound like an iPhone
I do not know love, I am a robot
Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba
I do not know love, I am a robot
Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba
I used to know love

[Chorus]
Cause I had a fire, passion and desire
Now all I require are circuits and wires
Inside was an ocean of soul and emotion
Then you cut me open, now all that I know is

[Bridge]
I am a robot
(Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba)
I am a robot
(Ba ba ba ba bum bada ba)
I used to know love

[Chorus]
Cause I had a fire, passion and desire
Now all I require are circuits and wires
Inside was an ocean of soul and emotion
Then you cut me open, now all that I know is

[Outro]
I am a robot

Rock me real slowly

These days, I'm lettin' God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reason you love me
Listen, you can hear them callin' my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my

[Chorus: Gabriel Garzón Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

[Verse 2: Drake]
She said you're my everything
I love you through everything, I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a whatever thing
Trust me, girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything

[Bridge: Drake]
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk, are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

[Chorus: Gabriel Garzón Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, these days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do
After we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

[Chorus: Gabriel Garzón Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do
[Intro]
I don't know what life will be in H.I.P. H.O.P
Without the boy H.O.V
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, I'm ready
When kingdom come I'm ready

[Verse 1]
Now everywhere I go they like HOV you back
Up out the corner office out the cul-de-sac
Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat
Get your swag back daddy where your focus at
Got to admit a little bit I was sick of rap
But despite that the boy is back
And I'm so evolved I'm so involved
I'm showing growth, I'm so in charge
I'm CEO and yeah glory to God
I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded
Selling blow in the park, this I know in my heart
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark
I been up in the office you might know him as Clark
But, just when you thought the whole world fell apart
I - take off the blazer loosen up the tie
Step inside the booth Superman is alive

[Chorus]
The King of New York, New York
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, uh huh
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I hear "hurry up Hov'" when I'm out in the public
'Cause niggas like: "but you love it; you be it, you're of it
You breathe it, we need it; bring it back to the hustlas"
Had to dust off the Hammer dance, can't touch this
C'mon playboys, bring the cars back out
'Cause ya boy Hov is back, you know them broads coming out
Got 'em dancing on the banquette, like they from Bankhead
Fuck Cristal, so they ask me what we drinking
I thought dudes remark was rude okay
So I moved on to Dom, Krug Rosé
And it's much bigger issues in the world, I know
But I first had to take care of the world I know
I'm from the bottom, so I still feel 'em from the bottom
Underdog before my cape, still couldn't stop him
Flash Gordon when recording, spark the light in the dark
Peter Park', Spider-Man, all I do is climb the charts

[Chorus]
The King of New York, New York
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, uh huh
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor

[Verse 3]
Just when they thought it was all over
I put the whole world on my back and broad shoulders
The War-Hova, but who you know took over tracks like that
Guess what New York, New York - we back
And I ain't never been afraid of a drought
Since I was six, seventeen been getting money down South
Bout it, bout it, Master P
Ask the nigga Pimp C, ask my homie Bun B
I run the streets the streets don't run we
Y'all run, we chill still waters run deep
I repeat, sing a long with me
I run the streets, the streets don't run we
Ladies saying "Where you been Superman?"
When niggas spending ten million in media on my hands
The Bruce Wayne of the game have no fear
When you need me just throw your ROC signs in the air, yeah!

[Chorus]
The King of New York, New York
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, uh huh
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
You already know how we came up
I'm saying it was a real pain in the butt (Ow)
If it's paper to touch, we may just cut you, scraping it up
Get your trachea cut and then escape in a truck
Smudge a lady makeup, bang the trey-eighty, wake the baby up
I just came for the weight like a gymnasium
I'm finna spray everything in my radius
Lately, my skin been looking radiant
The Mercedes is eighties sent
I have three sixes in my fate like Damien
I'd die before I let the jakes take me in
Babe, we everything we say we is (Facts)
My stable of women couldn't fit in the stadium
They sayin' me and Jon Bellion, we some aliens
And durags had us looking like Saudi Arabians
Your wave miscellaneous, we some ladies men
It's Roc, Marcberg be the alias
Now let's begin

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
Was never focused on gettin' bigger, just gettin' better
That's why I keep gettin' bigger after every record
Said I got lucky, the last record that y'all was blessed with
Watch me give you sequels, I'm Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon
I let the talent speak volumes, that's why there's different levels
I stopped the flexin' on socials, corny shit to impress you
You get too famous, then everything in your life is stressful
There's a big difference 'tween being known and being successful
Great grandfather, an immigrant from the Naples district
Dirty Guinea crew in the cut, call that the true incision
My wife thicker than liquor soaked in Italian biscuits
Cookin' minestron' every Sunday, call that a superstition
I left LA just to cook in Brooklyn, the winter's reaper
I sleep in Timbs and a Yankee fitted, that's just for leisure
I'm really better than everybody pretends to be
So ask the label now, why the fuck would I want an urban feature?
"I love the song and we really wanna know how you made it"
Or I could keep all you wondering how we been creatin'
It's annoying when cameras catchin' your every statement
And I've had enough of these corny artists that replicate it
Champagne supernovas destroy the morning glory
I'd rather build an oasis sober and thrive at 40
Don't get me wrong, I've been celebrating the life before me
But I see the wisdom in moderation for certain stories
When you're afraid to hurt feelings, you water down the worth
I'm done pretending your record's great and I'm down to work
Plus, I'll be actress and mixed with sociopaths
And when I'm worried about being famous for being down to earth
I spoke with Yahweh, he told me Jesus grafted us in
Which means my brother's my brother, it don't matter the skin
America needs to watch how they treat His chosen people
But that's for deeper than surface records, now let's begin

[Chorus: RZA & B.Keyz]
Now let's begin
Yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, uh
Now let's begin

[Verse 3: B.Keyz]
Uh, foot on the gas, foot on your neck, uh
One mashin', other gasping for a breath
I'm unclasped, capital punishment blast backwards
You tumblin', trash rappers who mumblin' for respect
I'm uncheckable, wide open, the foul technical
Go full press, I still glide like Clyde Drexler do
I'm done testin' two times over, I'll get the best of you
Better pay attention, two eyes open wide when I execute
And I been waiting so long that you asked for this
Try to give me your table scraps, I'ma give you my ass to kiss
I won't even wait for the dap, you'll get faded right after this
A masochist who ready to face the masses like Catholics, uh
And you can tell the whole school I'm prepped for the glory
In the presence of your professor, attendance is mandatory
With a weapon, freshman semester, you test the mess, it get gory
I'm just here to kill the game, let the messenger tell the story

[Chorus: RZA]
Now let's begin
Now let's begin

[Outro: Travis Mendes]
Palms in the sky, I'm feeling angel high
Funk got me sanctified (Funk got me sanctified)
Swim to the light, come save your soul tonight
Funk got me sanctified (Uh-huh, oh)
Funk got me sanctified (Sanctified, oh oh)
Funk got me sanctified (Oh, oh)
Palms in the sky, I'm feeling angel high (Palms in the sky, I'm feeling)

[Verse 1]
Been watching you for months and I'm tryin' to find a way now
To tell you what I'm seeing, it's heavy on my brain now
It's only moving faster, you're only sinking farther
I see it in your eyes now, it's only getting harder

[Chorus]
There's a house she doesn't know that you take care of
There's a light she doesn't know that you keep on
There's a "sorry" that you fake to keep her happy
When she thinks she hasn't seen you in so long
There are things that she's not able to remember
So I took tonight to put it in a song
That when she meets God, He'll tell her all about it
When my mother was a mother to her mom

[Verse 2]
Conversations with the Devil and he's telling me
What's the point in making memories
When you can't even find 'em when you're 70?
Conversations with my Father and he's telling me
There's a point in making memories
'Cause they'll be even better when we're heavenly

[Chorus]
There's a house she doesn't know that you take care of
There's a light she doesn't know that you keep on
There's a "sorry" that you fake to keep her happy
When she thinks she hasn't seen you in so long
There are things that she's not able to remember
So I took tonight to put it in a song
That when she meets God, He'll tell her all about it
When my mother was a mother
When my mother was a mother
When my mother was a mother to her mom

[Interlude]
For the mothers who are with us physically
Physically

For the mothers who are with us spiritually
[Verse 1]
I wonder why I get paranoid when I'm high
I wonder why I say yes to everyone in my life
I wonder why I can't run that fast in my dreams
I wonder why I feel short when I know my money's tall
I wonder why I miss everyone and I still don't call
I wonder why I can't run that fast in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Although I guess if I knew tomorrow
I guess I wouldn't need faith
I guess if I never fell
I guess I wouldn't need grace
I guess if I knew His plans
I guess He wouldn't be God, God, God

[Chorus]
So maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay
Maybe that's okay, maybe that's okay
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay

[Verse 2]
I wonder why I feel emptiness and I sing these blues
I wonder why I feel hopelessness when I watch the news
I wonder why I can't find my voice in my dreams
I wonder why they say hate your brother and hide your gold
I wonder why we all fear the things that we might not know
I wonder why I can't find my voice in my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Although I guess if I knew tomorrow
I guess I wouldn't need faith
I guess if I never fell
I guess I wouldn't need grace
I guess if I knew His plans
I guess He wouldn't be God, God, God

[Chorus]
So maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay
Maybe that's okay, maybe that's okay
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay

[Bridge]
All this shit, I can't explain
Is it by design or random fate, yeah

[Chorus]
So maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay
Maybe that's okay, maybe that's okay
Maybe I don't know, maybe I don't know
But maybe that's okay
[Verse 1]
It's still in San Diego
You can hear a baby cryin'
As the trains of New York City
Roll thunder down the line
The teachers rise in Richmond
As they sleep in San Anton'
While the harbor lights on Baltimore
Guide nurses headed home

[Chorus]
And the jails of Maricopa
Say a man is but his wrong
It's morning in America
But I can't see the dawn

[Verse 2]
Congressmen in Washington
Receive their brief and brew
While lead, it fills the pipelines
In a Detroit county school

[Chorus]
And I think of my grandmother
How she told me to be strong
It's morning in America
But I can't see the dawn

[Verse 3]
A junkie waits in Jacksonville
Prescription for the pain
As what the doctor ordered
Comes screaming through the vein
And in towns across the country
It's color that divides
When in working men and ladies
We could find our common side

[Chorus]
It's morning in America
It's morning in America
We're mourning in America
And I can't see the dawn, no
[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
I said wait 'til I get my money right
Then you can't tell me nothin', right?
Said wait 'til I get my money right
Then you can't tell me nothin' (Right)
Wait till I get my money right
Then you can't tell me nothin', right?
I said wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
Eighth grade, I feel depressed as shit
'Cause my heart is in the future
And I know where I belong, it just takes time
Fast forward, now I'm twenty-two
Half a million after taxes
Just to make a couple songs and I don't mind
Eighth grade, I feel depressed as shit
I'll be a fuckin' Warhol with this beat pad
Let me paint and hone my craft, it just takes time
Fast forward, now I'm twenty-two
Making artists feel self-conscious
From the honesty and soul and I don't mind

[Refrain: Mylon Hayde]
Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else muhfucka
Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else
Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else muhfucka
Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
I said wait 'til I get my money right
Then you can't tell me nothin', right?
Said wait 'til I get my money right
Then you can't tell me nothin' (Right)
Wait till I get my money right
Then you can't tell me nothin', right?
I said wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
Nineteen, I'm feeling scared as shit
Cause I'm dropping out of college
From an album made by Ye
I'm out my mind
Fast forward, now I'm twenty-two
And we just sold out S.O.B.s
"Look, son your future came today"
As my dad cries
Nineteen, I'm feeling scared as shit
I just got fired, fuck my boss
Cause all my bills have yet been paid
I'm out my mind
Fast forward, now I'm twenty-two
Yeah, I've been working, I deserve this
Yeah, I'm not afraid to say

[Refrain: Mylon Hayde]
Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else muhfucka
Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else
Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else muhfucka
Put the pause button on the weak shit
You sound like everybody else
You sound like everybody else muhfucka
You sound like everybody else
[Chorus: Alec Benjamin]
Lay me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's own are smiling cause my soul is fine
I did everything for New York

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
New Yorker in California, packed Brooklyn up in this bag
I'm in Malibu with the Bronx, she's in Kevin love with your man
Kyrie needed a king, I'm just making you understand
What I rustle up in the West, cause my reach is Kevin Durant
Records are very pop with a pocket deeper than sand
A juxtaposition, Sam Cooke, Billy Joel, Steely Dan
Changing the fucking spectrum, I need you to understand
Like I took the fall for some drugs
I've been nominated for Grams (It's Grammy's)
Skinny genius got blueprints up in my hand
So the minute you hear my single, just know that it's in my plan
Advantage of demographics, I'm Jigga, Bruno and Sam Smith
I'm moving business, I'm Taylor Swift in a van
This game, boy, is very, very advanced
I'm very, very New York, be very, very aware
How very, very Di Nero, I can get on a snare
Letting go of your throat, I can sing the hook if you scared

[Chorus: Alec Benjamin]
Lay me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's own are smiling cause my soul is fine
I did everything for New York

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
Meet me in the red dress when the stakes high
That's porterhouse
She's 5 foot 9 in a Rolls Royce, that's Slaughterhouse
Benny Hahn, Hahn's and a tall boy, we ordered out
The hell you need a chaser when all this liquor is watered down?
Wait, see all them lines is fuck boy chat
Don't be so impressed by all that fuck boy rap
This money gon' leave you empty if you just want that
See, my joy lies in the Son and you should jump on that
She'll make you think that she the wife and that you found the one
But she just looking for some powder, not the talcum one
I’m not judging, here in the middle like I’m Malcolm, son
Verbal trigger like you should never play around with guns
Bow down to no crown, these dudes was out for the count
'Cause the Sour Diesel was loud, I was pounding face in the lounge
Sober dope, moving proud, like allowance found in the crowd
When a thousand counting me out
But I'm here and killing the crowd now, blaow

[Chorus: Alec Benjamin]
Lay me down in Brooklyn if I lose my life
Push me down the Hudson and turn on the radio
Long Island's own are smiling cause my soul is fine
I did everything for New York

[Bridge]
Yo, I'm telling you
Yo, I'm telling you (Yeah)
Yo, I'm telling you
Yo, I'm telling you (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Jon Bellion]
Let me give the kids just a little help
Tell 'em money is not the key to wealth
'Cause if it can stop the pain
How the fuck do you explain a bunch of millionaires that killed themselves?
So you can take me off your winner's shelf
I got that different vision, I'm bringing help
I know the demons in the room
Gon' say it's more that I can chew
But now all I hear is the dinner bell
I need a family that loves me right
Don't need a chain, don't need a club at night
I had a conversation with an angel
She told me I'd cheat death if I stayed away from the party life
Dropped off in the land where the artists play
Where God's way is the hardest way
Told myself I'm keeping my faith
If it costs me my reputation, then take it, I give it all away
[Verse 1]
Bottle of red, bottle of white
My dad sent to me the other night
In the box there was a postcard just for fun
Saying everyone is proud, we miss you son

[Hook]
See my mother on Skype
Hear my sisters through postcards they write
Watch my niece grow through Instagram
Yeah, around the world my body will roam
But my soul’s in New York
My soul’s in New York

[Verse 2]
Light creeps in the hotel from the sun
All the homies left a voicemail from the pub
"Thinking of you, we’ll pour out a beer
But goddamn, Jon, we wish you were here"

[Hook]
See my mother on Skype
Hear my sisters through postcards they write
Watch my niece grow through Instagram
Yeah, around the world my body will roam
But my soul’s in New York
My soul’s in New York
See my mother on Skype
Hear my sisters through postcards they write
Watch my niece grow through Instagram
Yeah, around the world my body will roam
But my soul’s in New York

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
Drunk off your kiss, life turns sideways
Drugs from your skin, high like skyscrapes
Where your soul goes, you will find me
Follow you there, I will blindy

[Pre-Hook: Jon Bellion]
I don't believe that you're from New York
You're from the sky, past our view of space
Don't bullshit me, tell me you're an angel
And this ain't gon' make no sense no sense but I'll say

[Hook: Jon Bellion]
Your lips they taste like June
Your eyes are a rocket to the moon
Those legs gon' put me in a tomb
Praise God when you hit me with the, "Ooh"
Hit me with the, "Ooh"
Praise God when you hit me with the, "Ooh"
Praise God, praise god, go
Praise God when you hit me with the...

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion & Christianne Jensen]
Drunk off your kiss, tastes like absinthe
King size spaceship, hips crash landed
Scream out my name, ring like sirens
Lights in your eyes, gladly blinded

[Pre-Hook: Jon Bellion]
I don't believe that you're from New York
You're from the sky, past our view of space
Don't bullshit me, tell me you're an angel
And this ain't gon' make no sense, no sense, but I'll say

[Hook: Jon Bellion]
Your lips they taste like June

[Intro]
I'm working on dying

[Chorus]
Posted in the trenches, yeah, that's where I'm flexing
Philly what I'm repping, Oogie Mane, he killed it
Matt OX in the building, 'bout to break the ceiling
I don't think you feel me, am I too overwhelming?
Posted in the trenches, yeah, that's where I'm flexing
Philly what I'm repping, Oogie Mane, he killed it
Matt OX in the building, 'bout to break the ceiling
I don't think you feel me, am I too overwhelming?

[Verse]
I-I-I don't think they know where I be at (Be at)
I don't think they know who I be with (Be with)
Yeah, I'm headed to the top for the millions (The millions)
And I'm staying with my gang, I ain't scheming (Never)
Used to hate on me, used to sleep on me
Now I'm almost at the top where I was dreaming to be
Now they waiting for a song, they be fiending on me
Know lots of my homies still hustle on the streets
Yeah, I'm in the kitchen and you know I'm whipping
All my sauce is dripping, dip my chicken in it
Boy, you know I'm flexing, yeah, I'm up next, man
Riding in the Lexus, my homies get big checks
When I'm in the hood I'm the Big Bad Wolf
I be getting to this guap and it never is enough
I'ma get all this money 'til my bank is filled too much
I don't know why they fuss, they ain't ready for us

[Chorus]
P-P-Posted in the trenches, yeah, that's where I'm flexing
Philly what I'm repping, Oogie Mane, he killed it
Matt OX in the building, 'bout to break the ceiling
I don't think you feel me, am I too overwhelming?
P-P-Posted in the trenches, yeah, that's where I'm flexing
Philly what I'm repping, Oogie Mane, he killed it
Matt OX in the building, 'bout to break the ceiling
I don't think you feel me, am I too overwhelming?
[Verse 1]
I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait
I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner, we're making our fame
Bona fide hustler making my name
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner, we're making our fame
Bona fide hustler making my name

Pirate skulls and bones
Sticks and stones and weed and bongs
Running when we hit 'em
Lethal poison for the system
Pirate skulls and bones
Sticks and stones and weed and bongs
Running when we hit 'em
Lethal poison for the system
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Hit me on my burner prepaid wireless
We pack and deliver like UPS trucks
Already going hard, just pumping that gas
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Hit me on my burner prepaid wireless
We pack and deliver like UPS trucks
Already going hard, just pumping that gas

So, uh, no funny business (Are you ready all?)
Some some some I some I murder

Some I some I let go

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
Wu-Tang raised me, Death Cab changed me
You should go and ask Rihanna if the pen game's crazy
My artistry is everything, that's my baby
But when it comes to publishing, it's fuck you, pay me
Don't be mad cause the records that you cut sound lazy
And everything I'm cooking, sounding nuts like rabies (uh)
I hate rappers, please don't call me
Give me urinal suggestions like please don't stall me
Don't play for me, I'll be yawning
How I'm doing pop melodies and you sound corny
Now everybody trying to hang around like awnings
Me and my people linking in the park like crawling
Things seem Rocky, Drago, Ivan
No cash, broke bad, so damn Heisen—
Berg, check the chemistry, I found this hybrid
It's Dilla in the pocket but it's so Paul Simon
It took a little while for your mind to find it
But once you see the genius it's intimidating, isn't it?

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it?
Took a little while for your mind to find it
But once you saw the genius, it's intimidating, isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it?

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
They told me that my attention span aligns
Somewhat with the child or a fly, yeah
They didn't understand that I saw signs
Hearing things, but now they realize
That the woman that I prayed for became my wife
And dreams that I wrote down, they came to life
I figured out there's money in my mind
I'm glad I lived my life pre-occupied

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
You need to get that bag out my face
God made me a full-blown genius
What the fuck I need coke for?
You need to get that bag out my face
God made me a full-blown genius
What the fuck I need coke for?

[Verse 2: Blaque Keyz]
Outkast raised me, Lupe changed me
Now I do things with words to make you lames praise me
Whether Liu Kang or Luke James or Usain maybe
Feeling flyer than a jet son, I'm oh so Spacely
Now everybody clueless, how the flow so crazy?
Got me dashing with an actress, lookin' oh so Stacey
I hate rappers and I really mean it
Tryna ball with the kid'll get you sunned like Phoenix
Rather ball you up, feather and tarred
Until you're harder than sparring with Mayweather
With leather Spaldings
This is my calling, so I answer it with bars, but not for service
It's for hurting any person verses me
I've been rhyming since nurseries
Third degree burns, emerge from the furnace, get close to me
While I'm roasting one of these pigs, my flow is rotisserie
It's a pity that all these hoes slipping out of their hosiery
Won't get a hold of me, I slip through their fingers like Rosaries
Been waiting for you to find it
So I leave it where it's supposed to be
Cause once you see the genius, it's intimidating isn't it?

[Pre-Chorus: Blaque Keyz]
Isn't it? Isn't it?
Took a little while for your mind to find it
But once you see the genius, it's intimidating, isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it?

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
They told me that my attention span aligns
Somewhat with the child or a fly, yeah
They didn't understand that I saw signs
Hearing things, but now they realize
That the woman that I prayed for became my wife
And dreams that I wrote down, they came to life
I figured out there's money in my mind
I'm glad I lived my life pre-occupied

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
You need to get that bag out my face
God made me a full-blown genius
What the fuck I need coke for?
You need to get that bag out my face
God made me a full-blown genius
What the fuck I—

Beautiful Mind
[Verse 1]
Holy verses in his kiss
He was your bible
You found nature in his lips
The sex was tribal
He brought purpose to your hips
Your soul's revival
Such a hopeful Eve
But Adam let you down

[Pre-Chorus]
He played you fast and reined you in
No slow recital
You waited for him on the strip
But no arrival

[Chorus]
Gave it up for him
But only just to let you down
To let you down, to let you down
Gave it up for him
But only just to let you down
To let you down, yeah he let you...

[Post-Hook]
Now you wanna run wild
Now you wanna run wild
Now you wanna run wild

[Verse 2]
Your heart's been dragged from left to right
Your soul's in limbo
To suffocate your open mind
He closed the window
And thus revenge is in your eyes
Spare me the info
Such a hopeful eve
But Adam let you down

[Pre-Chorus]
He played you fast and reined you in
No slow recital
You waited for him on the strip
But no arrival

[Chorus]
Gave it up for him
But only just to let you down
To let you down, to let you down
Gave it up for him
But only just to let you down
To let you down, yeah, he let you—

[Post-Hook]
Now you wanna run wild
Now you wanna run wild
Now you wanna run wild

[Bridge]
You acting D12 crazy, this is so bizarre
That's just what happens
When you suffer from a broken heart
Tight jeans, warm thighs, but your soul is frigid
That's just what happens
When you make someone your true religion

You acting D12 crazy, this is so bizarre
That's just what happens
When you suffer from a broken heart
Tight jeans, warm thighs, but your soul is frigid
That's just what happens
When you make someone your true religion

[Chorus]
Gave it up for him
But only just to let you down
To let you down, to let you down
Gave it up for him
But only just to let you down
To let you down, yeah, he let you—

Now you wanna run wild

There's cost to paste
There's ins-between
I've been a man before
Simple and sweet

[Female voice]
"In the dark..."
[Chorus]
What if who I hoped to be was always me?
And the love I fought to feel was always free?
What if all the things I've done, yeah
Were just attempts at earning love? Yeah
'Cause the hole inside my heart is stupid deep, stupid deep

[Verse]
What if where I've tried to go was always here?
And the path I've tried to cut was always clear?
Why has life become a plan, yeah
To put some money in my hand?
When the love I really need is stupid cheap, stupid cheap

[Chorus]
What if who I hoped to be was always me?
And the love I fought to feel was always free?
What if all the things I've done
Were just attempts at earning love? Yeah
'Cause the hole inside my heart is stupid deep, oh, stupid deep

[Chorus]
What if who I hoped to be was always me?
And the love I fought to feel was always free?
What if all the things I've done (What if all the things I've done)
Were just attempts at earning love?
But the hole inside my heart is stupid deep, oh, stupid deep

Cocaine like the kid was born in '84
How long you really plan to sleep on me for?
When I decide to put my cape on the floor
Superman won't save you no more

[Verse 1]
Your favorite rapper's be taking beats that I'm shitting up
Your favorite lyricist's tell me that I don't spit enough
10 steps ahead of you musically, how you plan to stop me?
Just count your blessings that I consider rap a fucking hobby!

[Pre-Hook]
Cocaine like the kid was born in '84
How long you really plan to sleep on me for?
When I decide to put my cape on the floor
Superman won't save you no more

Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more
Superman won't save you no more, more, more—

[Verse 2]
Imagine locking the tone of Sarah McLachlan
The fashion of Jimi Hendrix in a box with the bible's doctrine
I look for potential wives, she looking for famous Johnson
She hungry for the action, in New York we call that Bronson

[Pre-Hook]
Cocaine like the kid was born in '84
How long you really plan to sleep on me for?
When I decide to put my cape on the floor
Superman won't save you no more

She literally told me:
"You're too much of a genius"
"You're gonna be too famous"
She literally left me—
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse

She literally left me—
Tell me that shit ain't a gift and a curse

1, 2, 3—1, 2, 3—1, 2, 3

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
You know that he trusts you and I know that he loves you
But somehow you convinced me again
My foundation rumbles and all my morals crumble
My father's warnings run through my head

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Your heart's a vine that I've bled trying to climb
Yeah, you're making a ruin of me
Try to survive, keep my spirit alive
But like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
One temptation sparked this
Now I can feel the darkness
It's my own fault, but you had this planned
All of me, you take now, like criminals and shakedowns
Yeah, you make me forget who I am

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Your heart's a vine that I've bled trying to climb
Yeah, you're making a ruin of me
Try to survive, keep my spirit alive
But like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
But like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me

[Bridge: Kimberly Perry]
All of your good is mine
All of your good is mine
All of your good is mine
All of your good is mine

[Outro: Jon Bellion]
Like a knife in the woods
Yeah, you hunt down the good in me, hey

[VISUAL]

You can't live your life on a bus...

EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY

A white bus opens its door and a flood of children run off laughing and screaming. After the initial burst, three girls get off laughing. After them, A LITTLE BOY steps off. He's walking slow and somber

All the parents in the parking lot are hugging and kissing their kids. Lots of kids are laughing. The Boy keeps walking until he reaches a black limousine parked at the far end

A chauffeur (old heavyset white guy) stands holding the door open waiting for The Boy

       CHAUFFEUR: Ey! Look who it is

He holds out his hand for a high-five. The kid jumps, hi-fives him, and slides into the limo

The Boy's FATHER (Rick Ross) is sitting by the far door. The limo starts off

The Boy and his father sit in silence for what feels like 8 hours

       FATHER: How was camp?

The Boy "shrugs"

       FATHER (CONT'D): You make any friends?

       THE BOY: No

The father laughs under his breath...but the laugh turns into a smh

       FATHER: Elise made you something special tonight

       THE BOY: Frito pie

       FATHER: I don't know. She didn't say-

       THE BOY (cutting him off): It's Frito pie

Silence. Father stares at him, then looks out the window

EXT. MANSION - DAY

The Chauffeur helps Father out the car. The Boy jumps out and walks toward the front of his home. The Mansion is dope. Very Big, and not gaudy. It looks classic

INT. MANSION - DAY

An infinity pool lines the horizon in the backyard. A spiral staircase fades up the wall and into the master bedroom upstairs. You can see all of this from the foyer, which has a large Buddha statue in the center of it. The place is very clean. Someone seems to care or is paid to care

The Father's phone rings:

       FATHER: Hello

       PHONE VOICE: Hello, this is the Califax collection-

Father hangs up. His cell phone goes off

The Boy walks into the kitchen. It's a big kitchen. There's a chef making food. He waves to The Boy. The Boy throws up a deuce. He gets a s'more Pop tart, then walks back out

INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY

The Boy walks in and drops his backpack and jacket in the doorway. He kicks off his shoes. They fly across the room, hit the wall, and fall in a pile of shoes on the ground. We see there's a big black/brown stain on the wall where The Boy's been kicking shoes for years. Doesn't look like he ever wears the same shoe twice

The Boy rips the bag of pop tarts open with his mouth as he sits at his desk and opens his laptop. There's a picture of a woman holding a child. She's wearing one of those fly tracksuits from 1995. The ones people wore a lot during the centennial Olympics

He starts checking his mail. His friend "FAM" sent him something that says "this is you" with a link. The Boy clicks the link and a video of a woman blowing a horse comes up. The Boy watches the video for longer than you should watch a horse blowing video. He closes the video

He goes onto HOTNEWHIPHOP.COM. There's a new Rich Homie Quan song out. It's listed as "VERY HOTTTTTTT". The Boy looks in the comment section, reading what people are saying

"This nigga sound like a broke-ass Future! [CRYING EMOJI]" is the top comment

The Boy stares. Then types "fuck u niggers" in the comments

He waits. He takes a bite out of his pop tart

He refreshes the page. People immediately respond with "Fuck U", "You wouldn't say that to my face faggot", and "LMFAO crackers b crazy"

The Boy smiles
...bec a use the in t e  rnet15 YEARS LATER*******[PLAY SONG "CRAWL" AT THIS POINT]*******

INT. THE BOY'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

The room is an elegant mess. There's shit everywhere, but everything has its place. Classic furniture; someone with old money would invest in, is used for the bed, desk, desk chair. You can see from where most of the trash accumulates that the occupant spends most of his time on the computer

There is a pile of stacked and flattened gummy bear wrappers by the desk. There's a picture of The Boy and his father on the boy's desk, along with a flash drive that has "hackz" written on it. A small vaporizer charges and glows green on the edge. There's a half ounce of weed in a plastic bag to the left of the laptop on the desk

There's a black and white Bill Withers poster, a Gorillaz "Demon Days" poster, and a "Black Dynamite" poster. All framed. Stacks of records are placed on a shelf lining the wall. There are some old 70's soul records by a record player on the shelf. Norman Connors "You Are My Starship" is the album on top of the others

Little hills of dirty clothes grow up the walls from the floor. Same pile of shoes is there. Wall with same dirty spot. The closet is filled with white shirts and flower shorts. There's one very old and tattered Shearling coat that hangs to the right

The Boy (more a man now) is sprawled out on his bed, no shirt and flower shorts. He opens one eye as very faint, dark orange sunlight from the blinds cut his face. He gets up

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

The Buddha statue again. There's empty old beer and Pellegrino bottles on the bar. The entire back of the living room wall is glass. The boy walks briskly to the kitchen

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

The kitchen is a slight mess. Things left out. S'mores makings left out. The marshmallows are hard as stones. The boy goes into the cabinet and pulls out a pop tart. He takes out a pop tart and throws it in the microwave, wrapper still on (you're not supposed to do that). He starts the microwave and begins texting someone. The microwave is okay for about 5 seconds, then blue sparks start to pop inside. He turns off the microwave, opens it, grabs the pop tart and tosses it on a plate

EXT. BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING

The Boy walks onto the little island in the middle of the infinity pool lining the oceans and mountains in the background. The mountains are surrounded by clouds. They're literally above the clouds. It's probably raining down there. There's an orchard with lemon and plums to the west of the wall outside, and a green statue of a golfer further in. Bunnies jump on the lawn in the background
The boy sits under a sun umbrella, opens the pop tart and starts to eat it. He looks off with his face flat. He gets a text message:

       FAM: when u wanna paddle out? [PURPLE DEVIL FACE EMOJI]

       The Boy texts back: pick me up

CUT TO:

EXT. MANSION FRONT DRIVEWAY - MORNING
An old, red (a gross red. a weak red) Mazda rolls up to the front of the mansion and sputters to a stop. FAM, steps out of the car. Daps up

       FAM: Let's take one of yours

       THE BOY: Nah

       FAM: Really, mane? You want us to drive around in my car? I don't think it'll make it, honestly. It broke down at my mom's. Plus... it looks like my car

       THE BOY: Right. It's inconspicuous

       FAM: My nigga, who are you hiding from? It's not stuttin. It's your car. Why do you even care?

"...why do you even care?"

       THE BOY: Aight

INT. GARAGE - MORNING

The garage door rises to reveal Fam and The Boy's silhouette. Five cars are in the garage. There's a Tesla Model S, Silver 911, some car no one's ever seen, a Tahoe and some car under a tarp. Looks like it could be an Aston Martin. Fam smiles

       FAM (pointing to the car no one's ever seen): That one-
       THE BOY: No
       THE BOY: The Bimmer

We didn't even see this one. It's in the far corner of the garage. It's a nice car. Older, but nice and sleek. Understated, to some. Its black paint is chipping in the front. Fam shakes his head

       FAM: Nah...nah

They get in the 911

CUT TO:

EXT. SANTA MONICA CONDOS - DAY

The 911 pulls up to a nice condo complex. Fam honks the horn for a while. Like a jerk

       SOMEONE FROM A WINDOW: I work nights, dickhead!

       FAM: I know. Fuck me, right?

Fam honks more
The Boy checks his Twitter feed. Twitter name "You Are Unimportant - @thegoldmolar" You can see from his feed he just trolls all the time. Politicians, athletes, entertainers, etc. His favorite was simply re-tweeting something someone says. When it was dumb enough to just re-tweet, that was his favorite. He'd gotten a lot of followers that way. Written an article once for a blog. Got more followers. He started posting videos of homeless people and fights
He was looking for something to retweet on his time-line. People say dumb shit all the time...
...someone tweeted "roscoe's wetsuit"

"...what's that?"

The Boy drops "roscoe's wetsuit" into Google. A Yahoo answer comes up for it. The answer to "what is roscoe's wetsuit?" is..."roscoe's wetsuit". Hilarious

SWANK, STEVE, MARCUS (Chance the Rapper), and AJ (STEFAN) walk out of the condo. They have longboards with them and they're eating candy. They stop in their tracks when they see the 911

       SWANK (re: boards): How we supposed to get these in there?

       FAM: You guys take your car

       STEVE: What about your boards? Where are they?

       FAM: Can we borrow some?

They all make a face

       SWANK: We need a bigger car then. I'ma drive to your house and get the Tahoe

       THE BOY: Come on, guys. This is taking forever

       AJ: Where we going?

       FAM: Dockweiler

       MARCUS: I swam into a diaper last time

       FAM: I'm GRIMEY. I ONLY SWIM IN DIRTY WATERS! YOU KNOW THIS!

       SOMEONE AGAIN: Shut the fuck up!

Fam honks the horn

       SWANK: I'm drivin that Porsche the way back. I know that shit

Swank and Steve walk toward their car parked on the street

       THE BOY: What's "roscoe's wetsuit" mean?

       FAM: I don't know

They drive off

EXT. DOCKWEILER BEACH - DAY

The guys carry the boards through the sand to ocean, making a strange pattern behind them

They setup camp and start changing on the beach

       MARCUS: I thought someone was bringing girls

       THE BOY: No one wants to get up this early

       MARCUS: Did you ask white girls?

       THE BOY: I asked every girl

       FAM: You a lie. You didn't ask anybody. You don't leave the house

       STEVE: Why white girls?

       MARCUS: Cause no one is getting up at 6AM to go into the freezing, dirty ass ocean, fuck up their hair-

At that moment, they all notice a girl sitting on her board in the ocean. Waiting for a wave she looks behind her. She is black

       MARCUS (CONT'D to AJ): See? This is what I mean about Donnie Darko happening to me

A plane flies low overhead. (Dockweiler is right next to LAX)

       MARCUS (CONT'D) (staring at the plane)
It's gonna crush me

       SWANK (re: girl): It's like seeing a mermaid

       STEVE: Maybe it's a manatee

       MARCUS (R. Kelly): I'ma flirt

Marcus runs to the water with his board. They all follow

EXT. OCEAN - MORNING

Marcus swims up to the girl on his board

       MARCUS: Sup

       GIRL: Hi

       MARCUS: I'm Marcus
       SASHA: Sasha
       MARCUS: It's lookin alright today
       SASHA (Australian accent): Yeah. It's the only reason I'm out here
       MARCUS: Oh, you're Australian (pause) You ever seen "Kangaroo Jack"?
       SASHA (not looking at him): Yeah
       MARCUS: Classic
       SASHA: ...wha?
       MARCUS (not mean...just serious): It's a fucking classic

Silence. Sasha is weirded out. All the guys, except The Boy, swim up

       STEVE (to Sasha. Out of breath): Hi. Did Marcus ruin it already?
       SASHA: Yes
Steve splashes Marcus
Swank takes a plastic bag with four blunts in it. He takes one out. He lights up a blunt. Talks with it hanging in his mouth

       SWANK: How long you been surfing?
       SASHA: Ten years. You?
       SWANK: Bouta month
AJ: Cops don't come out here. It's a good place to smoke. You want some?

He passes it. She takes a hit

       SWANK: What you doin tonight?
       SASHA: My friend's birthday in Santa Monica
       MARCUS: Yo, we're right around close. We're having a party tonight in a mansion. You should come. And if your friend's a girl or a guy who has weed, they should come too
       AJ: I'm Djing. I start off with Jodeci, then the switch over to 90's rap using "Dream Lover" to transition, play ACTUAL ATLANTA TRAP for an hour, hour and a half. Then motown, soul, and house. Girls. Go. Crazy
       SASHA: What's your DJ name?
       AJ: Twercules. no "DJ". Just Twercules. I got a tumblr where I post my mixes. It's getting pretty popular. I don't know. You sing? Model? Act?
       SASHA: I'ma go in

Sasha starts paddling and catches a wave into the beach

       AJ: I shouldn't have said "bitches"
       MARCUS (thinks): ...you didn't

AJ thinks on this. This is probably saying more about him than he realizes

EXT. BEACH - MORNING
Sasha carries her board onto the beach. The Boy is sitting there

       SASHA: You goin in?
       THE BOY: Don't know yet
       SASHA: Then why'd you put on your wetsuit?

...roscoe's wetsuit


       THE BOY: Everyone else was
       SASHA: That's an awful reason

She starts walking

       THE BOY: You should come to the party. It'll be fun. (then) They invited you, right?
       SASHA: Where is it?
       THE BOY: [EDIT]. Text me [EDIT]
       SASHA: I'll remember. I'll bring some friends

She walks off

Later that day:

*******[PLAY SONG "WORLDSTAR" AT THIS POINT]*******

EXT. I-10 - EVENING
The guys drive down the highway eating In-N-Out. Head nods all around. Swank is now driving the Porsche. Crazily. Fam is with The Boy and the rest of the guys in the other car. Marcus drops his animal style fries on the floor

       MARCUS: Fuck
       FAM: You see you fuckin up this car?
       THE BOY: It's fine
       FAM: He's driving crazy. (iphone goes off) And he's textin me

The text says: R E C K L E S S

       FAM (CONT'D): This nigga's so lame

The Boy sees a tweet of the lead singer of a boy band tweet "follow your heart and [HEART EMOJI] all who cross your path!". The Boy retweets it with a [LAUGHING/CRYING EMOJI]

       FAM (CONT'D): I gotta stop somewhere first

CUT TO:

EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

[VISUAL]

Fam pulls outside of a club. Lots of people are trying to get in. He and The Boy get out and walk to the bouncer, their friend CHEESE. Fam and Cheese dap. The Boy stands on the side next to a line of people trying get in VIP. They look at each other. He is not dressed appropriately to get in

Fam and Cheese do that handshake thing they do. Fam walks in

Some guys in a black SUV rolls by and yell at the dude next to The Boy

       MAN IN CAR: Dont let me catch you out here Jay! Don't let me catch you!

The Boy watches this for a second. He looks down for a moment...

Someone has spray painted "roscoe's wetsuit" on the sidewalk. He stares at it

       MAN IN CAR (CONT'D): I got yours, muthafucka!

The Boy snaps out of it. Then takes out his phone and starts recording the fight. Fam walks out and sees the fight in action

       JAY (I GUESS?): You scared, bitch! That's why you scared!
       MAN IN CAR: I got something for yo ho-ass my nigga!

POP. POP

..what's happening?

Jay is bleeding from his stomach. The Boy is seeing this through his phone. It takes a moment for him to realize-
POP. POP
...run. now
Fam is already running. Everyone in the line is screaming and running. The Boy runs

       COP: Drop your weapon!

(these are cleaner and succinct) POP.POP.POP

Runs to the side of the building. The SUV that was firing slows down. The driver is dead. Car horn blares as the car slows to a stop, mixing with girls crying and "oh shit!" and "fuck". Jay is very close to dead. The blood on the sidewalk is almost black. A street sign (No parking between 7-9am and 4-7pm) is reflected in the dark blood. He turns to The Boy, looks around. He knows what's happening. He's leaving

That was the end. He'll never read this sentence. Or any sentence. He ended earlier. Before this sentence. As far as he knows, before any sentence. He's back to his/the natural state

The Boy felt something

It's funny, cause this dude is dead. There really isn't a connection...it's more him seeing himself for the first time since-

       SOME NIGGA: Damnnnnn.....!

       HIS FRIEND: WORLDSTAR!

The Boy's phone rings:

       THE BOY: Yeah
       FAM: Get in the car

The Boy turns and sees the car rolling up to the alley he's hiding in. The Boy runs up and jumps in. They speed off

INT. CAR - NIGHT
       FAM: That shit was NUTS!
       STEVE: I knew something was about to happen. I knew it
       MARCUS: Donnie Darko. I'm tellin you

The Boy is looking at the footage on his phone. He's got a death on video. It's looped. Over and over

The Boy touches his shearling coat...there's a hole in it. Bullet hole? He puts his finger through...

...i shouldn't be (here)

He looks at Fam and Steve. They're talking

       MARCUS (CONT'D): Bitches high heels everywhere! They ran out they shoes, cuh

       FAM: BAP! BAP! BAP! Oooow. That nigga lit up

The Boy just keeps watching the video

       FAM: Yo. You got it on video?

       THE BOY: Yeah

       FAM: Wow...you caught the end of his journey on video. That's dope. (then) We gotta pic up Doc from the jazz club

INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

Fam and The Boy Stand in the back. Doc is on stage playing saxophone with a band. He's doing a solo

       THE BOY: Does it weird you out that you almost died today?

       FAM: Not really. I'm not trippin on death

       THE BOY: I'm not trippin. I'm just sayin, if you think about it, there's no reason for us to be here

       FAM: Doc be hanging with the weirdest people. Look at these niggas. They all look like James Blake. Is that who likes Jazz now?

       THE BOY: I was thinking about it and I can't offer anyone anything. Like, my job is tweeting at people. That's my job

       FAM: That's not your job. You do it cause it's funny. You're rich. We don't have to do anything

       THE BOY: Yeah. Isn't that sad?

       FAM: Sad? We are making moves. What about that line me and Swank are gonna start selling?

       THE BOY: All we did was print shirts for ourselves. Who else is buying that shit? And the whole reason we wanted to make shirts is cause Tre made some and they were dope

       FAM: I don't know what to tell you. We are doing dope shit. We are making moves. We can do whatever we want-

       THE BOY: But none of it matters cause we're doing it for ourselves! We're just jerking off for each other. No one in the future's gonna give a shit I made a shirt once

       FAM: Then don't make a shirt, my nigga

       JAMES BLAKEY LOOKING DUDE: Shhh!

The Boy fiddles with the hole in his jacket

INT. MANSION - NIGHT

All the guys walk in with plastic bags from the grocery store. They have blue cups, alcohol, s'more fixings, and gummy bears

If I was the director, I'd have everyone walk in in slow motion into the house with "Nosetalgia" by Pusha T playing

Walking into bedrooms. Opening drawers. Pulling out bags of weed

CUT TO:

AJ walks into his large closet. Pulls out a bowl. There are some prescription bottles there too

CUT TO:

A naked Marcus steps out of the shower and goes in his closet and pulls out some condoms

CUT TO:

Fam is meditating in the center of his bed. He's floating off the bed by about 4 inches
RAP GENIUS NOTE: This is the end of Part 1, continue on at Part 2
[Verse 1]
Tossed around like sea glass
And you rounded out my edges
I'll feel better when the headaches go away
I've got a scar across my forehead
Turning purple in the cold
From a night at Shore Memorial
I was sixteen and afraid
Turned away
Like I'm working babyface
Out of Mid-South in the eighties
I kept a blade hidden in my wrist tape

[Chorus]
I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight 'til my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
I think enough is enough

[Verse 2]
Hidden in the tall grass
In the naked light of day
Put my past self in the ground
I've been dancing on the grave
I'm not the person that I was then
I'm tearing him away
I was bitter, I was careless
I was nineteen and afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
But you deserve more from me
I don't know why I would say those things
But you deserve more than me
And I'm trying every day

[Chorus]
I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
I think enough is enough

[Bridge]
You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You were the baby teeth I buried
You were the sounds of distant cars

You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You were the banner that says "no one"
That I tattooed across my heart

You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You scattered like ashes across every song that I write
You’re where the light pollution starts

[Chorus]
I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
Enough is enough
[Intro]
Mm, CP Dubb
Bitch, I'm really timeless
Let me beat it up like Jaegen

[Verse 1]
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot leave my houses without diamonds
All the faces on my watches, jump out it
Change faces on the watches, now they frownin'
I probably spent the 100 thousand on fly shit
QP spent the 100 thousand on mileage
Bruce Lee kick it with me, I be stylin'
2 seater Bentley and it's topless
And she's topless, naked bitch driver
Papers and fronto wrapped around Sour
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really...

[Refrain]
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, "I love you", I was lyin'
I fuck with you but you was always like a side bitch
Cause I can never put nothin' over grindin'

[Verse 2]
I just left my baby girl a message
I said, I won't be comin' home
Hah, that's a dub, bitch, I'm on the road
Hah, and I need 20 thousand for a show
Hah, I ain't walkin' through your club no more
Hah, But if Lust hit me up I'll go
Hah, SpinKing that's the fuckin' bro
Hah, I fuck it up, I fuck it up some more
We switch the flow up, if you a busta I'ma cut you off
Bitch I'm goin' up
Gettin' money, what the fuck you thought?
Nigga, hold up it get ugly
I'm a fuckin boss, hah
Good now but I started off
Just a young nigga runnin' 'round and the butter soft
Try to run down on me nigga you should knock it off
I ain't get lucky mothafucka
Took a couple loses, yeah
What u sayin'? You ain't really on shit
Got zippers on my jeans like I'm Billy on this
I ain't sippin' no more lean I've been trippin' off it
I've been pissin' codeine and I ain't wit the shits, woah
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Wake up faded still end up drinking
Make-up on my t-shirt, I hate it
R.I.P. t-shirts, I hate it
Fall asleep, wake up still I'm faded
Bubba prolly lost 50 K in vegas
Pour up purple and then make it turn pinkish
Said that I was done with it but I'm still drinkin'
I can't waste no time, I can't waste no time with it
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
[Verse 1]
Open up the doors in the back of the church
And they all rise, they all rise
Take a couple steps of my breath in a dress
That is all white, it's all white
As your father lets you go
He will whisper soft and slow

[Chorus]
"Walk towards love," yeah
"Walk towards love," yeah
"Walk towards love"

[Verse 2]
This money's gonna come
And this money's gonna go
But that's alright, that's alright
'Cause everything could fall down
Everything can go
But it's all fine, it's all fine
They say love's a winding road
But it's simple if we both

[Chorus]
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love

[Verse 3]
Even the philosophers know, its a fact
That we all die, we all die
I know you're an angel
So if they call you back
In a short time, a short time
And you leave me in this life
I will follow close behind

[Chorus]
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love, yeah
Walk towards love, hum
[Verse 1]
I made a hundred grand this year
(Clap clap, clap clap, so what?)
Still lost, still feeling anxious
Still worry 'bout the same shit
I made a hundred grand this year
(Clap clap, clap clap, so what?)
Still lost, still feel depressed like
I'm tryna find a way in

[Pre-Hook]
I'm tryna figure this out
But my god, I'm so human
And so I turned to my sister and smiled
And asked this question

[Hook]
All we wanna know is where the stars came from
But do we ever stop—ever stop to watch them shine?
All we wanna know is where the stars came from
But do we ever stop—ever stop to watch them shine?
Or are we staring with—staring with ungrateful eyes?

[Verse 2]
I made a hundred grand this year
(Clap clap, clap clap, so what?)
Still hung up on opinions, still tryna find a way home
I made a hundred grand this year
(Clap clap, clap clap, so what?)
Still feel like I'm behind time, still worry where the day goes

[Pre-Hook]
I'm tryna figure this out
But my god, I'm so human
And so I turned to my sister and smiled
And asked this question

[Hook]
All we wanna know is where the stars came from
But do we ever stop—ever stop to watch them shine?
All we wanna know is where the stars came from
But do we ever stop—ever stop to watch them shine?
Or are we staring with—staring with ungrateful eyes?
All we wanna know is where the stars came from
But do we ever stop—ever stop to watch them shine?
All we wanna know is where the stars came from
But do we ever stop—ever stop to watch them shine?
Or are we staring with—staring with ungrateful eyes?
[Verse 1]
It's so empty right where your head sleeps
And she said "I still smell your cologne in my bed sheets"

[Pre-Chorus]
So I said "I'm just texting you to see how you're ho-holding on"
Then she said, "Some days, I'm okay
But when I'm alone, it hurts because..."

[Chorus]
The-the-the loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
The-the-the loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves

[Verse 2]
When did love letters get lost in translation?
Translation, translation
I heard you took the train from Penn Station
Penn Station, Penn Station

[Pre-Chorus]
So I said "I'm just texting you to see how you're ho-holding on"
Then she said, "Some days, I'm okay
But when I'm alone, it hurts because..."

[Chorus]
The-the-the loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
The-the-the loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
The-the-the loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
The-the-the loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves

[Verse 3]
I have to tape my mouth, I want to ask you questions
Like, "Do you sleep alone? I heard there's friends you rest with"
So I text her friend like, "Tell me where this man's at"
She said, "You got some balls, you don't deserve to ask that"
Oh, oh, they gotta be lying, I'm dying to know
But I know you're not mine, so I, I can't say shit

[Pre-Chorus]
So I said "I'm just texting you to see how you're ho-holding on"
Then she said, "Some days, I'm okay
But when I'm alone, it hurts because..."

[Chorus]
(The loneliness comes in waves)
Waves, waves, waves
(The loneliness comes in, yeah )
Waves, waves, waves
(The loneliness comes in, comes in, comes in)
Waves, waves, waves
The loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
The loneliness comes in waves
[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
We're six feet underground inside my bed
And all the little letters in my head
Were spelling suicide but not by choice
Was calling out for help, but heard no noise, no noise

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jon Bellion]
Only the sound of my back breaking
But ever since you and your arms saved me

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
The only friend I had wore black and red
The darker instruments inside my head
Were playing suicide but not by choice, by choice, yeah
Was calling out for help, but heard no noise, no noise

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jon Bellion]
Only the sound of my hands shaking
But ever since you and your arms saved me

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore

[Break: Jon Bellion]
Don't hold the weight of the world
I don't hold the weight, I don't hold the weight

[Verse 3: Blaque Keyz]
This the flow that helped me tip the scale
I'm stackin' chips like Chippendale's without the strippin'
Get the bailiff out cause Mr. Bellion's out the cell
We skip the bail and out the jail
We hit the trail, the route we took is hard to smell it out
So get to sniffin', equipped with the gift of spit like the lisp on the chick who played in the flick next to Spiderman
I'm brighter than LEDs on your TV
Keyz is sharp as a dagger
Who walks around with a swagger of Kenny G
When you see me, chill with the chatter
Got the skill of a master craftsman whose passion is rappin'
Snackin' on actors, so pass me a napkin
Chip on the shoulder, the kid is colder than both Dakotas
The winter soldier, assassin, coming after your captain
For honor and every day, I'm getting stronger
No one will shock the world, got a buzz like a mini Blanka
When they apply the pressure, it's heavier than E. Honda
Got what it takes to be great
But can't hold this weight any longer
[Hook: Jon Bellion]
When the lions come and they turn to fight
Will you lose your soul?
Will you lose your pride?
Cause the only thing they needs
To smell a drop of fear inside
When the lions come, will you turn to fight?

[Verse 1: Shy Grey]
Yeah, they tried to stop me
Tried to box me in the ring but I'm rocky
Indeed I'mma rumble
If the lions come I am, uh
Gonna be deemed new king of the jungle
I came from the bottom where it's not a problem
You know they got iron and chrome
And they firing at domes
And they hold more grams than retirement homes
I made it out all on my own, the homies know I was alone
But they be calling my phone, if they need some money
In other words I was a loan, now I'm in the zone
Should have been another statistic
But I said fuck it I'll risk it
Looked death right in the face and I kissed it
No evidence and no trace of the lipstick
Now ain't nobody gonna stop me now
Ain't nobody gonna knock me down
I'm from the school of the hard knocks
Breaking doors down they tryna lock me out
If you stayed to fight then you might have won
But they caught your ass cause you tried to run
Me, Jon B, Blaque Keyz, in a fighting stance when the lions come

[Hook: Jon Bellion]
When the lions come and they turn to fight
Will you lose your soul?
Will you lose your pride?
Cause the only thing they needs
To smell a drop of fear inside
When the lions come, will you turn to fight?

[Verse 2: Logic]
Yeah, lemme get it like this, lemme rip it like this
So sick, don't spit, I vomit
Bomb it, wearing the freshest of garments
Blowing up yeah we the bombest
Never cocky i'm just honest, reppin' artanis—woah
Maryland what I be reppin' the second I step in
I murder like weapon
Let me bring the tech and I'll hit ya like Tekken, I'm gone
Whatever record I'm on, I just wreck it and I'm gone
R-A—double T—P-A-C-K, V's up, all day, yeah we do it our way
I push white keys like Beethoven, while Blaque Keyz drop 16's,
Like the sistine, that's so mean
Hell yeah, that's so clean
Can I get it? Lemme get it, I got to get it
I got to spit it from the heart, lemme tear it apart
Living the real life, everybody want to wonder what it feel like
Rock with a drop top, living on top, lemme get it
I get ready to pop, when they bopping they head
When they rocking' the bed
If I couldn't do this then I'd be dead

[Hook: Jon Bellion]
When the lions come and they turn to fight
Will you lose your soul?
Will you lose your pride?
Cause the only thing they needs
To smell a drop of fear inside
When the lions come, will you turn to fight?

[Verse 3: Blaque Keyz]
Man it's unreasonable to think that Keyz won't leave MC's extinct
I never had a reason to, until now
To get that spear and hit that Jeep?
See me swerving like Steve Irwin through herds of nervous MC's
I sink my teeth in their verses, each feature becomes a feast
Lay back, relax in my den, get paid from the royalties
And bring it back to the pack and just let my family eat
I'm a predator on this beat, every metaphor is my prey
My roar rumbles your feet, I'll place your head on my tray
I'm letting your girl pat me, run fingers all through my mane
The pride of a dying breed with ferocity in my veins
At the top of the food chain, the philosophy is the same
So live properly, so one day they won't throw you in no cage
Keyz is king of the jungle no rumbling with the snakes
You running when I'm on the prowl
I pounce you can't keep the pace
You know I've been earning stripes, got zebra print on my face
Got to make it apart of ya
See the world through my wardrobe like Narnia

[Outro]
Beautiful Mind
[Intro]
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Beautiful Mind, Mind, Mind
She's literally like five feet away from me
While I'm recording this, sleeping on the couch
This is for her, sleepy ass

[Verse 1]
I wrote this while I'm watching you sleep (you sleep)
You're behind me on the couch in the studio
So I'm gonna make this lullaby sweet (lullaby sweet)
And soft so I don't wake you up
You're smiling as you sleep so you dig it
Only I can make some soft shit and rip it
I knew that you were dope from the jump like ribbit
'Cause all these other girls fall short like midgets

[Chorus]
The Sandman gon' flip when he come through
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
The Sandman gon' flip when he come through
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to

[Verse 2]
I wrote this while I'm watching you sleep (you sleep)
Your hair is all over the place and I love it
I won't put the bass in this beat (this beat)
If it knocks, then I might wake you up
You're smiling as you sleep, so you like it
She just let me work 'cause she know I cook diamonds
She know I'm paid, but she still nine-to-five-ing
That's why she allowed to hang while I'm writing

[Chorus]
The Sandman gon' flip when he come through
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
The Sandman gon' flip when he come through
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
While you count sheep, I'll give him music to jump to

[Bridge]
Dopest musical breakdown ever, ready?
If I make this, then maybe you will wake up and get naked
Girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm playing, maybe not
I make this, then maybe you will wake up and get naked
Girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm playing, maybe not
If I make this, then maybe you will wake up and get naked
Girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm playing, girl, I'm playing, maybe not
I make this, then maybe you will wake up and
Wake up and get, wake up and get, yah, yah
Wake up and get, wake up and get, yah, yah
Wake up and get, wake up and get, yah, yah
Wake up and get, wake up and get, yah, yah

[Outro]
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum

Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum
Ah, look who finally decided to wake up
Poppin Percocet's at the circus with Kirk Cameron
Standing in satin Hammer pants nervous and stammerin
Bursting cannons at cannibals slurpin cans of squirt with mannequins
Danimals licking yogurt from they mandibles
Famished, naked nurses with cans as big as the Earth is
Handing me burgers with sandwiches Candice Bergin
Copasetic my necklace was so deceptive
Told me that my check was supposed to be here before breakfast
I'm no detective, poked my nose in the septic
Tank while I'm robbin a bank on the coast of Texas
Posted becks bail drove of in a stolen Lexus
The modern guild that made us go on record Seth Rogen
[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Her body is cold, the conversation is cocaine
I'll call her Snow (Yeah, that's your new nickname)
Her body is cold, the conversation is cocaine
I'll call her snow (What up, Snow?)

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Yeah, what up to Snow
She always keep it funky like afros
A little bit of panic 'cause my heart's Titanic
Like, oh, we so DiCaprio
Yeah, what up to Snow
She always keep it funky like afros
A little bit of panic 'cause my heart's Titanic
Like, oh, we so DiCaprio

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
She knows more than me about Dragon Ball Z
How cold is that? How cold is that?
(Yeah, that's pretty cold, son)
She's so Andre to me, she's 3000 degrees
How cold is that? how cold is that?
(I, I think that she's ice cold then, right?)
I'm making music in a blue room
She walks in in black lingerie
And she likes Italian white kids
So when we hit the bedroom, we turning Fifty Shades of Grey
Nickname stuck, now she won't let it go
So now I'm undercover screaming, "Let it snow!"
Now we rubbing noses like we Eskimos
Beautiful Mind, you already know

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Her body is cold, the conversation is cocaine
I'll call her Snow (Yeah, that's your new nickname)
Her body is cold, the conversation is cocaine
I'll call her snow (What up, Snow?)

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
Yeah, what up to Snow
She always keep it funky like afros
A little bit of panic 'cause my heart's Titanic
Like, oh, we so DiCaprio
Yeah, what up to Snow
She always keep it funky like afros
A little bit of panic 'cause my heart's Titanic
Like, oh, we so DiCaprio

[Verse 2: Blaque Keyz]
Beautiful Mind, yeah
Say "Hello" to the woman frozen like pose in a tundra
I wonder if I propose, will she open up like umbrellas
Or will she close, I would hope that you were in the know
Cause that dress is wrapping around her like plastic on bags of blow
She so classic, I never pass it, so passionate, making racket
When raggin', grabbin' her toes, a total package and all
Never get in your face about movin' in steady paces
Throw those other broads away, just so her waist don't go to waste
I'm the detective on this case, but I've defected on this record
Investigating a case and pursuing her in a chase
I might ruin her when I'm through with her, but only she would know
If I broke her heart into pieces and dropped it when it was frozen
And I'm a snowman, we hold hands, I melt when she gets close
Grabbin' my carrot, I'm an addict for this habit I have chosen
As the weather's getting warmer and the season is done
I'ma make sure to keep you on the tip of my tongue

[Outro: Jon Bellion]
I'll call her snow
She's so cold, ba bada ba
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll call her snow
I'll call her snow
