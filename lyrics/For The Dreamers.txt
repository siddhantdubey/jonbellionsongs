[Verse 1: TiRon]
When you're young they tell you to get yours
But when you get old they tell you to get back
They start to close doors right up in your face
Like it ain't no thang, you caught in they trap
And now you're feeling lost, ain't got no map
Try to double back b-back, but can't do it
Cool outside, but inside you're losing your faith
And you hate the fact you ain't moving, yup
And you hate the fact you feel stuck (ugh)
Yup, you feel stuck
B-B-But, if i know one thing you should trust that thing inside of your gut
When you know that its just right
Know that it's just right
Know that it's just right

[Verse 2: Ayomari]
When you're grown they tell you get up
Get out and d-duh-d-do it
Shake the dust off, brush your shirt off
Work all day and night
Get up off your booty
B-B-But, if I must say I'm trying to get paid to play
Trying to get paid to play
Cash in, hit the jackpot
Jackpot, jackpot
'Til I'm winning in a major way
Major, m-m-made you look
Hungry in my stomach so I came to cook
Crooked letter, T-I-R
Stir it up, stir it up
Until I know that it's just right

[Bridge]
Know when it's just right
Know when it's just right
Right
Right
Know when it's just right
Right
Right
Know when it's just right
Know when it's just right
Know when it's just right
Right, right

[Hook]
Everybody say yeah
This ones for the dreamers up in here
Say yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 3: TiRon]
I know what it feel like, what it feel like
If I never made it big would I still write?
Never had a number one, never won nothing
Would I keep keep going on and on? (On and on)
Or get a J-O-B that I hate till it aches
Throw the towel in, see y'all on break
Trying to move but standing in one place

[Verse 4: Ayomari]
Gotta move 'cause moving is what it takes
If you feelin boo boo sitting on your doo doo maker
Can't take you where you wanna
Wanna do it, do it? Gotta own up, yup
Ain't nothin but a thang cause you know when it's just right

[Bridge]
Know when it's just right
Know when it's just right
Right
Right
Know when it's just right
Right
Right
Know when it's just right
Know when it's just right
Know when it's just right
Right, right

[Hook]
Everybody say yeah
This ones for the dreamers up in here
Say yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
