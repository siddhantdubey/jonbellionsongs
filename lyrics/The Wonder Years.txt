[Verse 1]
Tossed around like sea glass
And you rounded out my edges
I'll feel better when the headaches go away
I've got a scar across my forehead
Turning purple in the cold
From a night at Shore Memorial
I was sixteen and afraid
Turned away
Like I'm working babyface
Out of Mid-South in the eighties
I kept a blade hidden in my wrist tape

[Chorus]
I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight 'til my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
I think enough is enough

[Verse 2]
Hidden in the tall grass
In the naked light of day
Put my past self in the ground
I've been dancing on the grave
I'm not the person that I was then
I'm tearing him away
I was bitter, I was careless
I was nineteen and afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
But you deserve more from me
I don't know why I would say those things
But you deserve more than me
And I'm trying every day

[Chorus]
I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
I think enough is enough

[Bridge]
You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You were the baby teeth I buried
You were the sounds of distant cars

You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You were the banner that says "no one"
That I tattooed across my heart

You left me walking in circles
You were a shot in the dark
You scattered like ashes across every song that I write
Youâ€™re where the light pollution starts

[Chorus]
I think I'm growing into someone you could trust
I want to shoulder the weight until my back breaks
I want to run till my lungs give up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
If I could manage not to fuck this up
Enough is enough
