Poppin Percocet's at the circus with Kirk Cameron
Standing in satin Hammer pants nervous and stammerin
Bursting cannons at cannibals slurpin cans of squirt with mannequins
Danimals licking yogurt from they mandibles
Famished, naked nurses with cans as big as the Earth is
Handing me burgers with sandwiches Candice Bergin
Copasetic my necklace was so deceptive
Told me that my check was supposed to be here before breakfast
I'm no detective, poked my nose in the septic
Tank while I'm robbin a bank on the coast of Texas
Posted becks bail drove of in a stolen Lexus
