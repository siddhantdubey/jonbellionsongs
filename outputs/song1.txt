Hey, we had a great time, we can't stop
Yeah, we got the ladies dancing around us
That's why we wore sparkly t-shirts

[Pre-Chorus]
(It's okay, you're not supposed to, it's okay to admit it)
I'm not judging, I'm just telling you
You treat me like a friend
Just like when you played with me?
Same kids, the same teachers
And I'm getting the same records, but I treat you like I treat everyone else
I treat everybody the same way

[Chorus]
(Just like before), still playing, still trying to impress you
But you know I'm just showing up to change the way you do
Changing the way you do, boy)
Now you try to change me too
But you know I'm just some kind of backbreaker

[Verse 1]
I made a record this time, try to prove it's still good
But all I got was a record that said "Don't worry, we just done something good for you"
And then you start to write about my life in record
That's what I'm focused on, man)

[Chorus]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're just trying to make the best of what we've got
But we end up writing like we're trying to write the best of everyone else
I hope your record is too, I hope it's just for the best
'Cause my mother forgave me once for everything
I've got so much more to offer, I might just end up in jail

[Verse 2]
I made a record this time, try to prove it's still good
But all I got was a record that said "Don't worry, we just done something good for you"
And then you start to write about my life in record
That's what I'm focusing on, man)
